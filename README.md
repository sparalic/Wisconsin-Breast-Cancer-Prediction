# Predicting Breast Cancer
By: Sparkle Russell-Puleri, Ph.D.

# Background:
According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is caused by the uncontrolled growth of breast cells, which leads to the formation of a tumor. These tumors can start from different at different locations in the breast. However, the vast majority of breast cancers begin in the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancers). While, others can start in the glands that make breast milk (lobular cancers). There are also other types of breast cancer that are much less common.
Tumors that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. A tumor is considered malignant (cancer) if the cells grow into (invade) surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. And benign breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast and they are not life threatening.

# About this project:
This breast cancer prediction model will be done utilizing Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this project is develop a machine learning classification algorithm that
Attribute Information: 1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 4) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 5) perimeter 6) area 7) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 8) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 9) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 10) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 11) symmetry 12) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
The above attributes are diveded into three categories:1) The mean (3-12), The standard error(13-22), and "worst" or largest (23-36) (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image.
